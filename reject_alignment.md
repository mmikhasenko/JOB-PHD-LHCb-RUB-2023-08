# Update on Your Application to the LHCb Bochum Group

Dear [Candidate's Name]

Thank you for your interest in joining the Hadron Spectroscopy group at Ruhr University Bochum. I have carefully reviewed your application and the materials submitted.

After a thorough evaluation, I regret to inform you that I am unable to offer you a position in our group at this time. The primary reasons being a low scoring for interest in the resonance physics of QCD, and a limited alignment between your past research experience and the current direction of studies within our group.

I appreciate your interest in our group and wish you the best of luck in your future academic pursuits. I am confident that you will find a program that aligns well with your research interests and expertise. Thank you once again for considering the LHCb Bochum group as a potential step in your academic journey.

Best regards,

  Mikhail
