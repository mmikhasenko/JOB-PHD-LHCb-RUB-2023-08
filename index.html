<h1 id="phd-student-position-in-particle-physics-at-ruhr-university-of-bochum-lhcb-group">PhD Student Position in Particle Physics at Ruhr University of Bochum (LHCb Group)</h1>
<p>The newly established LHCb group at Ruhr University of Bochum, Germany, focused on hadron spectroscopy, invites applications for a PhD student position in particle physics with LHCb experiment.</p>
<h2 id="research-focus">Research Focus:</h2>
<p>Our projects are centered on the spectroscopy of hadrons, with a keen interest in the identification and study of exotic states. The successful candidate will engage in physics analysis using LHCb data, particularly:</p>
<ul>
<li>Investigations into the properties of tetraquarks and pentaquarks</li>
<li>Spectroscopy of charm baryons</li>
<li>Search for glueball candidates in central exclusive production</li>
</ul>
<p>Additionally, our group is involved in the development of read-out electronics for the upgrade of the SciFi detector. This offers the candidate a remarkable opportunity to delve into the design of the readout chip, front-end board, and the test station for the next-generation read-out chain.</p>
<p>Our close collaboration with the leading theorists from the Joint Physics Analysis Center, <a href="https://www.jpac-physics.org/">JPAC</a>, offers a platform to work on fronter of particle phenomenology, broaden the research horizon, hone analytical skills, and boost the publication rate.</p>
<h2 id="supervisor">Supervisor:</h2>
<p>PhD students will be under the expert guidance of the group PI, Dr. M. Mikhasenko (<a href="https://github.com/mmikhasenko/">GitHub profile</a>).</p>
<p>Some previous works:</p>
<ul>
<li>Notable LHCb papers: <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/2623821">Lc polarimetry</a>, <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1879440">OmegacXX spectroscopy</a>, <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1915358">Tcc discovery</a>, <a href="https://inspirehep.net/literature/1728691">Pentaquarks’ studies</a></li>
