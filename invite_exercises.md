# PhD LHCb-RUB: invitation for a zoom Interview 

Dear [Candidate's Name],

Congratulations on advancing to the next stage of our selection process!
Your motivation and experience have truly caught our attention, and I am eager to learn more about you and your aspirations.

I am excited to invite you to a Zoom call where we can further explore your interest and introduce you to our group.
To make our discussion more engaging and insightful, I've prepared a set of 4 fun problems encompassing the areas of physics, statistics, and programming.

These problems are designed not only to gauge your knowledge and skills but also to spark a lively and collaborative discussion.
I anticipate that addressing these problems will require a substantial investment of time and thought and glad to assist should you have any questions.

The journey to finding the right fit is a two-way street.
If, upon reviewing the preparation sheet, you feel that the problems or the potential role might not align with your interests or expertise, I welcome you to share your thoughts with me.
I appreciate the time and effort invested in this process and fully support your decision should you choose to retract your application.

I am looking forward to having a fruitful and enjoyable discussion with you.
Please let me know your availability to schedule the interview before September 30th.

Best regards,

  Mikhail
