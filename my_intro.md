# Introduction of the group

## Location

- [Bochum city](https://maps.app.goo.gl/jhP9Tc6zo5K9ewBu8)
- [Campus](https://maps.app.goo.gl/uyEPZsB8Ep3vmPsG9)

## Research Focus

- primary areas: hadrons, scattering theory
- specific projects: pentaquarks, coupled channel model, tetraquarks, di-Jpsi, glueballs
- technical: partial wave analysis, pheno models, fitters, ML

## Recent Achievements: phenomenology and model building

- Omegac and charm baryons in PRD,
- Tcc in Nature,
- a1(1420) in PRL
- Polarimetry in JHEP

## Collaborations

- International: LHCb, JPAC, COMPASS
- Local: BESIII, Panda, GlueX
- NRW-FAIR

## Future Directions

- Physics:
  - Molecules vs Compact structure
  - New production mechanisms of exotics

- Techniques:
  - Dealing with high-stat model
  - Accessability of PWA models, symbolics

- Detectors:
  - front-end
  - SiPMs
  - SciFi upgrade

- Team:
  - PI + 2 PhDs + 1 Postdoc
  - 1-2 postdocs for SciFi in mid 2024

## Mentorship and Growth Opportunities

- center of Europe, strong support of science in Germany,
- good connection to top places for QCD (Bochum, Bonn, Julich, Darmstadt, Mainz, Munich),
- and Flavor physics (Dortmund, Heidelberg, Freiburg), 8h/2h to CERN.
- opportunities: data analysis, phenomenology training, hardware component
- teaching obligation
- good flux of master/bachelor students to work with
- training for writing grant proposal / research statement

## Resources and Facilities

- Computer cluster, GPU cluster
- LLM, software
- Labs

## Expectations from the Candidate

- focused and committed to research,
- determined to get the first research paper our,
- involved in teaching
- nominally 3y, possible +1 extension

## Funding and Grants

- the position is paid by NRW/FAIR for 3y,
- group is being supported by BMBF LHCb
